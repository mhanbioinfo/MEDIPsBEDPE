Description: MEDIPS was developed for analyzing data derived from
        methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) experiments followed
        by sequencing (MeDIP-seq). However, MEDIPS provides functionalities for the analysis of any kind of quantitative
        sequencing data (e.g. ChIP-seq, MBD-seq, CMS-seq and others)
        including calculation of differential coverage between groups
        of samples and saturation and correlation analysis. MEDIPsBEDPE can now take in leanBEDPE
        as input. This version also saves GRangeObj after a function reads in BAM or BEDPE,
        so subsequent functions that requires the GRangeObj no longer need to re-read in BAM or BEDPE.
